# Welcome to Currency Converter 1.1!

This little website lets you convert between various currencies. For now I limited the number of available currencies to **8** and guess what - Bitcoin is one of them!

Here's the link: [CC1.1](https://jamieshifter.github.io/currency_coverter/)

## How to use it?

First you need to choose the currencies you want to convert **FROM** and **TO**.
To do this - you simply use the drop-downs and click the desired currency.
Then you just need to write the amount of money to want to convert in the first "Amount" field
> **Note:** You can also use the arrows in the field for small step changes(0.01) 

That's it! The calculation should be done automatically without you having to click anything else

## "Reverse" button

You can click the "Reverse" button to switch the currencies backwards:
* In the first currency field I have EUR
* In the second currency field I have USD
* I click "Reverse" button
* Now USD is in first field and EUR is in second
* RECALCULATION follows!

## From where do I get the ratios

Currently the ratios for currencies are fixed, the long term goal however is to get them from a live site via API(probably).
